Simple Japanese flash cards.

There are three decks, `normal', `review' and `mastered'.

Questions in the `mastered' deck will only be shown with the `-m' command-line option.

Some keys:

  x: move question to the `mastered' deck.
  m: move question to the `review' deck.
  p: practice mode (show only questions in the `review' deck)
